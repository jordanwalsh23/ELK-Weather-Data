This high is expected to maintain a ridge over coastal parts for the next few days as it drifts slowly east, likely reaching the Tasman Sea early in the new week. As a result, coastal winds should remain generally southerly through this period.</text><text type="preamble">Wind gusts can be 40 percent stronger than the averages given here, and maximum waves may be up to twice the height.</text><text type="warning_summary_footer">Details of warnings are available on the Bureau's website www.bom.gov.au, by telephone 1300-659-218* or through some TV and radio broadcasts.</text><text type="product_footer">* Calls to 1300 numbers cost around 27.5c incl.
