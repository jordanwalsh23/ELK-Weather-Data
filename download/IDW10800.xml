It may approach the western boundary of the region over the weekend, and there is a slight chance that it could move east of 90E on Sunday. Severe TC Emeraude is most likely going to remain west of 90E and move back towards the west or southwest from Monday onwards.</text><text type="potential_cyclone_3_header">Likelihood of this system being a tropical cyclone in the Western Region on:</text><text type="potential_cyclone_3">A very weak system near 11S 105E, is forecast to slowly move to the southeast. The environment is generally unfavourable for significant development, however a brief window of slightly better conditions exists on Sunday and Monday whilst the system remains north of 15S. As the system lacks significant structure as of Saturday afternoon, the risk of the system reaching tropical cyclone intensity on Sunday is Very Low, and only a Low risk on Monday. By Tuesday conditions become more unfavourable and the risk returns to Very Low.</text></forecast-period><forecast-period index="1" start-time-local="2016-03-20T00:00:00+08:00" end-time-local="2016-03-21T00:00:00+08:00" start-time-utc="2016-03-19T16:00:00Z" end-time-utc="2016-03-20T16:00:00Z"><element type="cyclone_2_probability">Low</element><element type="cyclone_3_probability">Very Low</element></forecast-period><forecast-period index="2" start-time-local="2016-03-21T00:00:00+08:00" end-time-local="2016-03-22T00:00:00+08:00" start-time-utc="2016-03-20T16:00:00Z" end-time-utc="2016-03-21T16:00:00Z"><element type="cyclone_2_probability">Very Low</element><element type="cyclone_3_probability">Low</element></forecast-period><forecast-period index="3" start-time-local="2016-03-22T00:00:00+08:00" end-time-local="2016-03-23T00:00:00+08:00" start-time-utc="2016-03-21T16:00:00Z" end-time-utc="2016-03-22T16:00:00Z"><element type="cyclone_2_probability">Very Low</element><element type="cyclone_3_probability">Very Low</element></forecast-period></area></forecast></product>
